# StarCraft 2 Demake Project

This is a personal project recreating the campaigns of StarCraft 2 Wings of Liberty, Heart of the Swarm, Legacy of the Void, and Covert Operations in the StarCraft 1 engine, by way of the campaign editor.

Feel free to clone the repo or download the zipped file of the levels, and place them in the directory

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\StarCraft\Maps\campaign\Starcraft 2
```

Note that these levels require the Brood War expansion to be run.

Additionally, feedback is welcome. Please leave any bugs or balance problems in the issues so I can track and complete them.

This project is still under gradual development, and you can find information about what levels have been completed underneath.
